                    <p>
                        As technology develops, it is becoming more convenient and cost-effective for employers to conduct job interviews online. 
                        Virtual interviews reduce transportation costs, speed up the interviewing process and allow hiring managers to interview non-local candidates.

                                <h6>Video calls</h6>
                                <p>
                                    The most common type of online interview is a video call. 
                                    When setting up a video call, the interviewer will typically contact you and ask if you have access to the necessary equipment. 
                                    Most laptops have built-in cameras and microphones, so you should be able to find a computer that meets the requirements.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The interviewer will schedule a specific time in which they will call using a program like Skype, Zoom or Google Hangouts. 
                                    During a video call, the interviewer will be able to converse with you like they would normally.
                                    These interviews are short, usually less than 30 minutes and may be as short as 10 minutes During an in-person interview. 
                                    If you are familiar with webcam technology, a video call should be fairly simple for you to set up and navigate. 
                                    The key to a successful video call is preparing thoroughly ahead of time

                                <p>
                                    Another method for online interviews involves you recording a video of yourself answering interview questions. 
                                    To prepare for this type of interview, the interviewer will send you a list of questions and a deadline. 
                                    You will need to set up a camera and film yourself while you answer each question on the list. 
                                    After you have finished, you will need to upload the video and send it back to the interviewer.
                                </p>

                    <a href="#offline-tips"><h5>Offline</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        If you are going to meet or come to the company building, then be prepared for the offline interview.
                        You will meet face to face with the recruiter and talk to them directly. 
                        In this case, make sure you got the hard copies for your resume.

Remember, one of the best solutions for interview anxiety is practicing your answers ahead of time.

                        <p>
                            Well before the scheduled interview time, you will need to select a location for your interview. Find a quiet room with minimal background noise and no distractions. Make sure you have adequate lighting (preferably natural) and that nothing is distracting behind you. Make sure your housemates know not to disturb you and shut any pets out of the room. A professional backdrop will show the interviewer that you are serious about the interview and the job.

                        <p>
                            Find a notebook and pen and set them within reach of your computer. Consider printing out a copy of your resume that you can consult during the interview. You might also want to make a list of questions or talking points that you would like to bring up in the interview. These tools can all be helpful, but make sure they do not divert your attention too often during the interview.

                            In addition to preparing answers to some common interview questions, it is also advised that you prepare several questions of your own. Ask the interviewer about job requirements, the benefits and salary or what they think of the company. Any questions that allow the interviewer to share additional information about what they expect from the ideal candidate will help you in the next stage of interviewing.

                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            Making eye contact during an online interview is more difficult than you might think. 
                            When answering questions, you will need to focus your gaze directly into the webcam instead of at the interviewer's face or your own. 
                            Maintaining eye contact and nodding will show the interviewer that you are involved and listening attentively.

                        <p>
                            It is harder to read body language through a video, so be especially aware of your nonverbal cues. Remember to smile and nod when the interviewer speaks. Sit up straight and act as you would during an in-person interview. You obviously will not be able to shake hands when signing off, so you will need to show your professionalism and good manners in other ways.
